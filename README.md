# Classification-Project_Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
mobile price range prediction is a machine learning project I will implement this project using machine learning algorithms it is a very popular machine learning project. In this project estimate the price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market, you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem I  collect sales data of mobile phones of various companies. I have implemented a Mobile Price Prediction using different Machine Learning Algorithms. This project will classify the price range of the mobile price. The price ranges from 0-3. Iâ€™ll discuss the price range in the dataset. It's a classification problem. Now I have trained a mobile price classification using 3 ML algorithms. This model classifies the range of the mobile based on the different parameters like from camera, touch screen, cores, battery, clock speed, internal memory, battery capacity, etc. After training the model using 3 algorithms, I compared all the models using the graph. In this problem you do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.
